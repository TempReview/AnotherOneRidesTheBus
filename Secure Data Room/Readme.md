## Commuting versus Moving Decisions during the Transition to Higher Education

This folder contains scripts that can be used to replicate our Results in the Secure Data Room in Cologne.

## Contents of this Repository

This repository includes the following scripts in the specified execution order:

1. **Data_Prepare.R**: Script to prepare and clean the dataset for analysis.
2. **Data_Descriptives.R**: Script to generate descriptive statistics and initial visualizations.
3. **Data_Analysis.R**: Script to perform the core data analysis related to commuting versus moving decisions. It contains the bare models calculated, including models that are not included in the paper.
4. **Data_Model_Evaluation.R**: Script to evaluate the models and interpret the results. It contains statistical tests and models that have been forgotten in the `Data_Analysis.R` part. In the final submission, this will be updated.

## Execution Instructions

Each of the scripts should be executed in the specified order. The scripts contain commented lines that are used to create the export files within the Secure Data Room (SDR).

These commands should be executed manually in the console to generate the required export protocols.
